Thanks for sending the reply on 28/Mar/2022 in printed. Association has read through your points and here is our reply

<ul>
<li> To your points 1,2,3 in the reply document
We totally sympathize with you and we fully support you & your family. Rest assured we would be there for any help you may need.  </li>

<li> To your points 4 in the reply document
You are right about the payments done for 2019. There was a typo on the pending dues communicated last time. With corrections done, the actual dues is for 22 months starting Jan 2020 till Oct 2021. .  </li>

<li> On 4.2 (bullet 2 under section 4), you have mentioned that you were not in town from April 2020 till October 2021 and are requesting a waive off. To this association had informed in the 20th Feb 2022 meeting that on humanitarian/exceptional ground we can waive off 50% of the maintenance for this tenure though that is not the norm. The existing norm is that full maintenance requires to be paid if the unit is occupied even if the resident is away post occupying the unit. It was also highlighted in the meeting that multiple units which had resident out of town for many months during the pandemic had still paid the full maintenance. We also agreed with you in the meeting that your car park could be rented out to clear the pending dues ( point 5 in the reply document). But since you reversed your position on this in just few days after the meeting, this possibility of association waving of 50% maintenance is cancelled unless you tell us the plan & promise to stick to that  </li>

</ul>
